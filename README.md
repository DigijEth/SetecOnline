 # **White Paper: Setec Online - A Decentralized BBS System on Ethereum**  
## **Version 1.0 | February 2025**  

## **1. Abstract**  
**Setec Online** is a **decentralized Bulletin Board System (BBS) built on Ethereum**, designed to provide a **Web3-powered communication network** that is censorship-resistant, community-driven, and tokenized. Unlike traditional BBS platforms, **Setec Online** leverages **Ethereum smart contracts, decentralized storage, and blockchain-based identity verification** to enable secure and immutable discussions, reputation-based governance, and asset-backed memberships.

The system is built using **Svelte + Electron** for a **cross-platform experience**, supporting both **desktop (Electron) and web-based environments**. By integrating **ENS (Ethereum Name Service), ERC-20 tokens, and ERC-721 NFTs**, Setec Online allows users to participate in a decentralized forum where access, reputation, and privileges are managed transparently through smart contracts.

## **2. Introduction**  
### **2.1 Background**  
Traditional BBS systems played a crucial role in early online communities, providing a text-based platform for discussion, file sharing, and collaboration. However, modern forums are often centralized, leading to issues such as **data censorship, lack of user ownership, and susceptibility to platform shutdowns**.

Setec Online aims to **revive the spirit of classic BBS networks** while integrating **Ethereumâ€™s blockchain technology** to ensure **data permanence, user autonomy, and decentralized governance**.

### **2.2 Key Features**  
- **Decentralized Message Storage**: Posts and discussions are stored via **IPFS/Arweave** and referenced on-chain.  
- **Tokenized Membership**: Users hold **ERC-20 governance tokens** to participate in moderation and decision-making.  
- **Reputation & Access Control**: Using **soulbound NFTs (non-transferable)** to track user reputation and access levels.  
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Private messages use **Ethereum-compatible encryption (zk-SNARKs & Lit Protocol)**.  
- **Ethereum Name Service (ENS) Integration**: Users can register and verify their identity with their ENS domain.  
- **Smart Contract-Based Moderation**: Community-driven moderation through **DAO-like governance mechanisms**.

## **3. Technical Architecture**  
### **3.1 System Overview**  
Setec Online consists of three core layers:  

1. **Frontend (Svelte + Electron)**  
   - Cross-platform UI for **desktop and web**.  
   - Web3 authentication via **Ethereum wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Ledger, Trezor)**.  
   - Real-time discussions via **decentralized nodes**.  

2. **Backend (Ethereum Smart Contracts & Storage)**  
   - **Smart contracts handle user reputation, access control, and post verification**.  
   - **IPFS/Arweave for decentralized data storage**.  
   - **zk-SNARKs for encrypted messaging and private posts**.  

3. **Blockchain Layer (Ethereum Mainnet & L2 Scaling)**  
   - **Base Layer**: Ethereum Mainnet (for critical governance and token logic).  
   - **Layer 2 Scaling**: Arbitrum or zkSync for **low-cost transactions and micro-payments**.  

---

## **4. Key Components & Functionality**  
### **4.1 Decentralized Message Storage**  
- Posts and replies are **hashed and stored on IPFS**.  
- On-chain transactions contain **metadata & references** to off-chain storage.  

### **4.2 Tokenized Membership & Governance**  
- Users must **hold an ERC-20 token (SETC) for posting privileges**.  
- **Staking SETC tokens** gives users governance rights (voting, moderation).  
- Reputation is tracked through **non-transferable soulbound NFTs (SBTs)**.  

### **4.3 Reputation System & Access Control**  
- Users earn **soulbound reputation NFTs** based on engagement.  
- Posts are **weighted** by user reputation to prevent spam.  
- Moderation is handled through **on-chain DAO voting**.  

### **4.4 Web3 Identity & Authentication**  
- **ENS integration** allows users to sign in with their **Ethereum domain**.  
- **zk-SNARK-based privacy layers** enable **encrypted private forums**.  
- **Gnosis Safe** for multi-signature admin actions.  

---

## **5. Security & Privacy**  
### **5.1 Censorship Resistance**  
- No centralized entity controls postsâ€”content is stored via **IPFS/Arweave**.  
- DAO-driven moderation ensures **community governance**.  

### **5.2 Private & Encrypted Messaging**  
- **zk-SNARKs encrypt messages** while keeping interactions on-chain.  
- Private BBS boards require **NFT ownership for access**.  

### **5.3 Smart Contract Security**  
- **Audited ERC-20 and ERC-721 contracts** prevent exploits.  
- **Multisig-controlled admin functions** ensure governance transparency.

## **7. Tokenomics (SETC Token)**  
### **7.1 Token Utility**  
- **Posting Rights**: Users stake SETC to post & reply.  
- **Governance**: Staked SETC allows users to vote on BBS policies.  
- **Moderation Incentives**: Trusted users earn SETC for moderating.  

### **7.2 Token Distribution**  
- **Community Rewards**: 50% (for active participants)  
- **Development Fund**: 20% (smart contract & platform upgrades)  
- **Liquidity & Exchanges**: 20% (DEX liquidity & incentives)  
- **Founders & Early Backers**: 10% (vesting over 3 years)

## **8. Conclusion**  
Setec Online is the **next evolution of decentralized forums**, reviving the classic BBS experience while integrating **Ethereumâ€™s Web3 capabilities**. By leveraging **smart contracts, IPFS, and DAO governance**, we ensure a **secure, censorship-resistant, and community-driven discussion platform**.

Unlike traditional social media, **users own their content, reputation, and governance rights**â€”paving the way for a **truly decentralized, tokenized, and self-sustaining Web3 forum**.
